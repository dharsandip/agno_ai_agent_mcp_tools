In this project, Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools from Agno framework has been used with Agno AI Agent and Llama4
LLM for connecting to various MCP Servers and getting our queries/questions answered. 
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI Agents to interact with external systems or tools through a standardized interface
in a structured and consistent way. We can connect out Agents to any MCP server using Agnoâ€™s MCP integration.
MCP defines a common protocol for tool invocation, making it easier to plug tools into AI agents without custom code for each tool. 
In this project we connect to mcp-server of airbnb for enquiring about hotel information, 
we also connect to mcp-server of firecrawl for getting information on some recent topic through web scrapping/crawling.
In both of the cases, it connected to the corresponding mcp server successfully, collected the required information and answered
our query.
